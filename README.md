# Sandwich-Daemon
Sandwich Daemon allows you to manage multiple bots within a single application. Easily create new bots and scale up already running bots with rolling restarts, multithreaded and microserviced with a hint of web dashboard for easy customization.

## Why should i use this?
Sandwich Daemon is useful if you have multiple bots running or you just generally want more control over how your bot interacts with the gateway or want to get into microservicing your bot. It is scalable and is fairly lightweight.

Sandwich Daemon was made to allow for a single process to interact with the gateway instead of having 18 discord.py instances each doing it themselves, it also allows for all the caches to be stored in a single place which is useful when having a bot dashboard.
